 * Add session cleanup functionality
 * Add documentation
 * Break up as separate source files (e.g. files for state, salt+hash, server stuff, etc...)
 * Password hashing needs to be solidified soon so apps using
   this framework don't get stuck with a password database that only
   works on an old version of the library.  (Since passwords cannot be
   easily migrated)
