 * Change to more reasonable package (e.g. Happstack.Extra.Auth or something similar)
 * Cabalize for ease of installation (not sure about this if code is subsumed by happstack)
 * Break up as separate source files (e.g. files for state, salt+hash, server stuff, etc...)
 * Password hashing needs to be solidified soon so apps using
   this framework don't get stuck with a password database that only
   works on an old version of the library.
